# PFF Scores Explained
https://www.pff.com/grades

Grades are determined on a play-by-play basis and strictly on performance, not outcome of the play. For example, a play may occur where a quarterback throws a perfect pass that is dropped by a wide receiver. Even though the outcome of the play is negative, the quarterback will receive a positive grade as he performed his job above average, but the wide receiver will receive a negative grade as he performed his job below average. A player receives zero points if they perform their job as expected, and up to +2 or -2 in 0.5 increments based on positive or negative performance. 

At the end of a given game or season, the plus-minus grades are standardized on a scale of 0-100. In our dataset, the grades given are for the whole 2024 season.

### This is the repository for the HackUSU group comprised of Ben Gonzalez, Luke Nichols, Hailey Hendrickson, and Dillon Johnson.

This repository stores the data for an XGBoost model that analyzes the factors that influence a player's likelihood to enter the transfer portal in collegiate American football. This model analyzes college NIL collective amounts, team win/loss percentages in recent seasons, and player positions. This was a 24 hour project for HackUSU 2025 at USU. Future considerations include player hometowns/geography, eligibility, injuries, playing time, academic longevity, climate, team culture, and specific school data.
